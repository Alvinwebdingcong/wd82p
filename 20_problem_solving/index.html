<!-- # problem Solving

1. Understand the problem
2. plan
  - algorithm - pseudocode
  - psuedocode:
  1. kapag ang user ay nag type ng number 
  2. Mag create ng variable kung saan ilalagay natin ang value na zero
  3. mag crate pa ng isang variable na maghohold ng value na nilagay ni user
  4. habang mas mababa ang counter variable kumpara sa numero na ininput ni userm dagdagan ito ng isa 
  5. i-print ang value ng counter variable sa console.

3. Divide and conquer

## Solving Fizz Buzz
write a program that takes a user's input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. However,for multiples of three print fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print fizzbuzz.
1. plan
- an input to collect the number from user
- the desired output is a list of numbers from 1 to the number that the user entered. but for numbers divisible by 3, print Fizz. and for numbers divisible by 5, print Buzz.
And for numbers divisible by both, print fizzbuzz.
-Pseudocode:
1.when a user inputs a number
2. loop from 1 to the entered number
3. if the current number is divisible by 3 then print "Fizz"
4 if the current number is divisible by 5 then print "Buzz"
5. if the current number is divisible by 3 and by 5 then print "FizzBuzz"
