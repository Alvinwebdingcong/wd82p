        <h2>Ave Maria College</h2>
        <p>
          Ave Maria College is the first Catholic college in Liloy, Zamboanga
          del Norte. Founded in the historical tradition of Catholic education
          due to its timeless relevance, this institution promises quality
          education that leads to the formation of men and women with
          intellectual and moral capacities to eventually contribute to the
          development of the town of Liloy and its neighboring communities.
          Dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Ave Maria College is managed by
          top administrators with professional training and experience from
          leading universities here in the country and abroad. At Ave Maria
          College, learning takes place both inside and outside the classroom as
          students, faculty, and staff work together to integrate academic,
          social, and spiritual components for a vibrant college experience.
