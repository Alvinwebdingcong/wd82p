      <h1>Ford Mustang latest version</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
      The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford.
      In continuous production since 1964, the Mustang is currently the
      longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its seventh generation,
      it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony
      car" automobile segment, the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line
      of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines,
      initially distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.[3]
      Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang
      became the most successful vehicle launch since the 1927 Model A.[4]
      Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda),
      over 400,000 units were sold in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang
      was sold within two years of its launch.[6] In August 2018, Ford produced
      the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle was
      a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.[7] The success of the
      Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American
      manufacturers, including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird[8]
      (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge Challenger[9] (1970). It also
      competed with the Plymouth Barracuda, which was launched around the same
      time. The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupes worldwide,
      leading to the marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United
      States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury). The Mercury Cougar was launched
      in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang; during
      the 1970s, it included more features and was marketed as a personal luxury
      car.
