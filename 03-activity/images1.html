      The third-generation Mustang was produced by Ford from 1979 until 1993.
      Built on Ford’s Fox platform, it is commonly referred to as the Fox body
      Mustang. It evolved through several sub-models, trim levels, and
      drivetrain combinations during its production life. It underwent updates
      for the 1987 model year and seemed destined for replacement with a
      front-wheel drive Mazda platform. However, company executives were swayed
      by consumer opinion and the rear-wheel drive Mustang stayed, while the
      front-wheel drive version was renamed the Ford Probe. Enthusiasts group
      the generation into two segments: the 1979–1986 cars, with their quad
      headlight arrangement, and the 1987–1993 cars, with their aerodynamic
      composite headlamps and front fascia styling. Production ended with the
      introduction of the fourth-generation Mustang (SN-95) for the 1994 model
      year.
