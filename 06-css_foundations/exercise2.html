      garden. Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with
      the vegetables top enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to make the
      function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.

    <h2>What to plant</h2>
    <p>
      Plant are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and
      form.Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide
      food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenace.
      Potager can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide
      array of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the
      formality of a knot garden.
