              Ave Maria College is the first Catholic college in Liloy,
              Zamboanga del Norte. Founded in the historical tradition of
              Catholic education due to its timeless relevance, this institution
              promises quality education that leads to the formation of men and
              women with intellectual and moral capacities to eventually
              contribute to the development of the town of Liloy and its
              neighboring communities. Dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Ave
              Maria College is managed by top administrators with professional
              training and experience from leading universities here in the
              country and abroad. At Ave Maria College, learning takes place
              both inside and outside the classroom as students, faculty, and
              staff work together to integrate academic, social, and spiritual
              components for a vibrant college experience.
